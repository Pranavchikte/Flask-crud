Of course. The original README is strong, but we can elevate it to a top-tier, professional standard that truly stands out to recruiters and senior developers.

The key improvements focus on:

  * **Clarity and Reproducibility:** Adding prerequisites and `cURL` examples so anyone can test your API in seconds, without even opening Postman.
  * **Demonstrating Deeper Knowledge:** Explaining the *why* behind your project structure and adding professional touches like license and badges.
  * **Enhanced Structure:** Adding a "Features" section for a quick overview and refining the installation flow.

Here is the improved version. Just copy the content of the cell below and paste it into your `README.md` file.

# Flask CRUD API with MongoDB (Dockerized)

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11-blue.svg)
![Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-2.3-black.svg)
![Database](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-6.0-green.svg)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)

A scalable and modular Flask RESTful API for performing **CRUD operations on a MongoDB database**. The entire application is containerized with **Docker and Docker Compose**, ensuring seamless setup, portability, and deployment.

This project was built to demonstrate best practices in API design, clean code architecture, and modern development workflows.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Full CRUD Functionality:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for a `User` resource.
- **RESTful API Design:** Clean, intuitive endpoints following REST principles.
- **Dockerized Environment:** Includes `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for one-command setup.
- **Scalable Project Structure:** Organized using Blueprints and an Application Factory pattern for maintainability.
- **Secure Password Handling:** Uses `werkzeug.security` for password hashing and verification.
- **Object-Document Mapper (ODM):** Leverages `MongoEngine` for elegant and Pythonic database interactions.

---

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.11, Flask
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **ODM:** MongoEngine
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **API Testing:** Postman, cURL

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a modular, feature-oriented structure designed for scalability and separation of concerns.

````

This structure, centered around the **Application Factory pattern** (`create_app` in `__init__.py`), decouples components, making the application easier to test, maintain, and scale.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Pranavchikte/Flask-crud.git](https://github.com/Pranavchikte/Flask-crud.git)
cd Flask-crud
````

### 2\. Configure Environment Variables

Create a local `.env` file by copying the example template. The default values are already configured for the Docker setup.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Your `.env` file will contain:

```
FLASK_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/users_db
```

### 3\. Build and Run the Application

With Docker and Docker Compose running, execute the following command from the project root:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

1.  Build the `flask-app` image based on the `Dockerfile`.
2.  Pull the `mongo` image from Docker Hub.
3.  Start both containers and connect them on a shared network.

Your Flask API will be running and available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4\. Stopping the Application

To stop and remove the containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal and then run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
